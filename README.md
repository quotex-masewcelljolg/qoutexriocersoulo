# Quotex Stop Loss: A Complete Guide for Indian Traders

## What is Quotex Stop Loss?

A stop loss is a risk management tool that helps traders limit potential
losses in their trades. When a trade reaches a certain predefined level
of loss, the stop loss order is triggered and automatically closes the
